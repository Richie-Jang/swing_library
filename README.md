Swing Library
=============
This library contains a number of advanced components



Expandable Arcordian :

Just like in Outlook, a slider on the left opens and closes menu options

TextArea Expander :
-------------------
http://blue-walrus.com/2011/02/expandable-text-area-in-swing/

This component is a text area which has a special bottom right corner. When a user hovers over this corner, it can be dragged, and the whole component can then have its size readjusted. You see this component a lot in web pages.

Tree Filter :
-------------
http://blue-walrus.com/2011/03/swing-filtered-tree-just-like-in-eclipse/

It's a standard JTree with a textfield on the top. As the user types in the textfield, the tree branches are filtered. Quite common in IDEs like Eclipse.

Row Number Columns :
--------------------

At a fixed number column to a JTable. Makes it look like an Excel Sheet.
